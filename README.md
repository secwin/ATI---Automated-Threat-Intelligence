# ATI---Automated-Threat-Intelligence
ATI was first created as Chrome extension for the purpose of quickly collecting cyber threat intelligence data/IOC available on the internet. It was created for Cyber Threat/Incident Response or SOC experts to quickly collect IOC data they find in social media or the internet and integrate it with security products.
It offers the opportunity to automatically parse all the IOC data you encounter while browsing Twitter or any other site and transfer it to a local Excel file.
Roadmap:
* Transmitting collected IOC data directly to SIEM and/or SOAR products
* Correction and improvement of incorrect parts.
